## Create a new project

The first thing you want to do, when creating a new project, is actually creating the structure of your new C++ project.
If you often create new projects, you know that can be redundant and a bit borring. So why not make it fully automaticly by using one command ?

First, go where you want to create your project, and create a new folder for it.
```shell
cd path_to_projects && mkdir new_project
```

Then, create the structure of your new project, with everything you need to begin.
In my case, my project is named "new_project"
```shell
bscxx create new_project
```

You should see a structure which looks like this:
