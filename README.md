# BSCXX
> BSCXX (for bootstrap CXX project) is a very light utility software, written in C++ 17, to help you starting quickly a new C++ project using cmake. 
It's really end goal is to be a package manager, to easily include C++ modules and libraries to your project, deeply inspired by npm (node.js), composer (php) and cargo (rust).

You have trhee choices to install bscxx. You can download the first release (for now, it's just available on Windows 64 bits system), and add it to your path environment.

You can install automaticly bscxx with the help of scoop, a windows package manager for portable applications.
